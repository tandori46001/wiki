    mode set the mode type for your wifi network interface. For connecting to access points the value should be set to infrastructure, which is the default.
    bassid is the name of your wifi connection, as configured on your access point.
    band is used to set the wireless band. It accepts two values: 5GHz and 2.4GHz. If left unset, the wifi endpoint and your network device will automatically establish the best band. By setting this value you will force the connection to use a specific band.
    channel is used to set your wifi channel, and only takes affect if the band property is set.

WPA and EAP connection modes accept the following configurations.

    key-management sets how the supported key management mode.
        none to disable key management
        psk for WPA with pre-shared key, common for home wifi.
        eap for WPA with EAP, which is common for enterprise wifi networks.
    password sets the pre-shared key or password for your wifi network, when the mode is set to either psk or eap.
